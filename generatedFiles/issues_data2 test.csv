Latest development branch build (please note build date below) 

Issue was mentioned in the forum thread https://discourse.jabref.org/t/inability-of-jabref-to-restore-preferences-after-a-version-update/4296/3

### Operating system

macOS

### Details on version and operating system

_No response_

### Checked with the latest development build (copy version output from About dialog)

- [X] I made a backup of my libraries before testing the latest development version.
- [X] I have tested the latest development version and the problem persists

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

1. Open the entry editor
2. Adjust the preview window position on the right, e.g. reduce the width 
3. Close JabRef and restart
=>  The window position is reset

Step 2:

After restarting JabRef

Implementation details:
The EntryEditorPreferences need to be enhanced with a new Property for the Preview Position, similar to how it's done for the divider position which remembers the height.

- [X] I have tested the latest development version and the problem persists

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

1. Select a group
2. Copy a doi from somewhere 
3. Click anywhere in the table and paste, jabref will correctly create a new entry with the selected group assigned
4. Copy another doi from somewhere
5. Click anywhere in the table and paste, jabref will create a new entry but not assigned to the group. In fact it will not show up in ""all entries"" immediately, and one needs to click a few random groups back and forth, until that works. But still, the new entry is not assigned to the group that was selected first.

Note: 
This is related to issue #8933, it seems that after the first copy-paste in both instances, the group is somehow ""deselected"", even though it is still shown as selected.
Issue  #11085 might be related too
